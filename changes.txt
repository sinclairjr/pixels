Changes made in response to reviewers - Round 2.


Rev2 specific comments:

Most of the points have been clarified, however I still find difficult to figure out how works the readout of the device. The name R.O.I. is not so well chosen, referring to the trigger language.

Lines 68-70 are very vague, maybe a range for V_Bias should be given for definiteness.

JS Line30  --  added sentence to introduce ROI.

Old:
"To make use of existing cold wire readout electronics for the measurements described here, a form of analogue multiplexing had to be employed."

New:
"To make use of existing cold wire readout electronics for the measurements described here, a form of analogue multiplexing had to be employed.
The multiplexing scheme divides the pixel plane into a number of Regions Of Interest(ROIs), where pixels in different ROIs can share the same channel."

JS Line54 -- added comment on physical definition of ROI.

Old:
"An inductive focusing grid surrounds the pixels, it is made from \SI{152.4}{\micro\metre} wide copper traces split into 28 regions.
There are \num{6 x 6} pixels per region, giving a total of 1008 pixels."

New:
"An inductive focusing grid surrounds the pixels, it is made from \SI{152.4}{\micro\metre} wide copper traces split into 28 separate grids, these grids form the ROIs.
There are \num{6 x 6} pixels per ROI, giving a total of 1008 pixels."

JS Caption Fig1 -- Expanded to include definition of ROI

Old:
"Initial (July 2016) prototype pixelated anode PCB. The pixelated readout area is \SI{100}{\milli\metre} in diameter. Each charge collection pixel is a \SI{900}{\micro\metre} via, at a pitch of \SI{2.54}{\milli\metre}, inductive focusing grids formed of \SI{152.4}{\micro\metre} copper traces surround the pixels. There are 28 inductive focusing grids with 36 pixels per region, a total of 1008 pixels."

JS Caption Fig2 -- include ROI and low-pass filter

Old:
"Circuit diagram for pixel and inductive focusing grid (ROI). Pixels are directly coupled to the preamplifiers. ROIs are coupled to the preamplifiers via a \SI{10}{\nano\farad} capacitor, and are connected to the bias voltage via a \SI{10}{\mega\ohm} resistor and an RC filter. The RC filter consists of another \SI{10}{\mega\ohm} resistor and a \SI{10}{\nano\farad} capacitor to ground."

JS Fig3 -- added label to ROI and Pixel DAQ channels

JS Line 84 -- reitterated the ROI definition

Old:
"The multiplexing scheme divides the pixels into a number of Regions Of Interest (ROIs), the following is taken from [23]."

New:
"As mentioned, the multiplexing scheme divides the pixel plane into a number of ROIs, each ROI is defined as the pixels contained within a single section of inAs mentioned, the multiplexing scheme divides the pixel plane into a number of ROIs, where each ROI is defined as the pixels contained within a single section of inductive focusing grid. 
The following is taken from Ref [23].
All pixels at the same coordinate inside each of the ROIs are connected to the same DAQ channel, i.e. only one DAQ channel connects all the pixels in the top left corners of all ROIs, and so on.
A simple example is shown in Figure 3, which demonstrates how 16 physical pixels can be read out using only 8 DAQ channels.ductive focusing grid."


DG Lines 68-70 -- added bias voltage numbers
old:
The bias on the inductive focusing grids had to be sufficient to allow full
charge transparency (all charge collected by the pixels), yet low enough to
minimise any risk of damaging the cold coupling capacitors.

We took measurements with bias voltages varying from \SIrange{0}{300}{\volt}
DC.
Optimal results were achieved at \SI{250}{\volt}.
