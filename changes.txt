Changes made in response to reviewers - Round 2.


Rev2 specific comments:

Most of the points have been clarified, however I still find difficult to figure out how works the readout of the device. The name R.O.I. is not so well chosen, referring to the trigger language.

Lines 68-70 are very vague, maybe a range for V_Bias should be given for definiteness.
