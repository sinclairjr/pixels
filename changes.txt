Changes made in response to reviewers.

Rev1 specific comments: 

Line3 and line 16: It is stated that the TPCs are slow detectors. I think that this statement is a bit misleading (especially in the abstract), since it gives the impression that the pixelated readout, beside fixing the problem with the ambiguities in event reconstruction, makes the TPC response faster.

Line 53: It is true that the “ktc noise” is sufficiently known, but I think it could be useful to define the variables in the equation.

Lines 71-72: “LARASIC4*s were designed for traditional wire readouts, which require fewer channels than a pixelated readout of equivalent dimensions”. This sentence is a bit obscure to me. I don’t think that the “traditional wire readout” is universally defined. In general terms, the dimensions depend on the pitch. It is possible to build a pixelated readout with a pitch size large enough to cover a surface larger than the one covered by a wire readout.

Lines 78-96: I had to read three times this paragraph in order to understand the multiplexing scheme. Eventually I figure it out, but I wonder whether this description could be made clearer.  Part of the problem is probably given by Ref 21: this is an important reference, however I could not find it on web. In case it is not possible to provide a better reference, I think it can be helpful to add a figure to explain the multiplexing scheme.

Rev2 specific comments:

Though the noise of a pre-amplifier indeed increases with the capacitance of the detector connected to it, the scaling with sqrt(C) (line 53) is only part of the question, and usually the scaling is almost linear. The thermal noise is likely to be subdominant at these cryogenic temperatures. By the way, the equation of line 53 is not in reference [18]. It would be better to give the noise dependence on the capacity of the detector for the LARASIC4 pre-amplifier, if this information is available.

The cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter is of the order of 0.1 kHz, which looks very low. Maybe the capacitor to ground in this filter not 10 nF, but rather 10 pF?

The transition from Figure 8 to Figure 9 is rather obscure, justified by a mere reference [35,36].

Optimising the number of ROIs allowed us to readout the 1008 physical pixels
with only 64 DAQ channels (28 ROIs + 36 pixels).

Figure~\ref{fig:mux} demonstrates how 16 physical pixels can be read out using
only 8 DAQ channels.
Optimising the number of ROIs allowed us to readout the 1008 physical pixels
with only 64 DAQ channels (28 ROIs + 36 pixels).
The non-square numbers are the result of geometrical constraints on our
readout plane.

Vias were used for pixels instead of pads in order to minimise capacitance.
It is important that capacitance is minimised when amplifying charge since
thermal noise scales with capacitance:
$Q_{\mathrm{Noise}}=\sqrt{k_{\mathrm{B}}TC}$~\cite{noise}.

new:
Vias were used for pixels instead of pads in order to minimise capacitance.
It is important that capacitance is minimised when detecting charge since
thermal noise ($Q_{\mathrm{Noise}}$) scales with capacitance ($C$) according
to
\begin{equation}
  Q_{\mathrm{Noise}} = \sqrt{k_{\mathrm{B}}TC} \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ the temperature
(derived from~\cite{noise}).
It should be noted that the dependence on capacitance can become even stronger
depending on the preamplifier used.
However, as we want to keep considerations as general as possible, the
influence of the preamplifier will not be discussed here.

The final step consists of a Kalman filter for track identification.
For this, we used the well-established GENFIT track fitting
package~\cite{genfit1, genfit2}.
Ionisation losses and multiple scattering are taken into account.
While generally applicable to any particle type, as a proof of concept we
assumed a minimum-ionising muon with an initial momentum of
\SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt} in the direction of the track estimate from the
PCA.
To deal with potential outliers still remaining after the PCA, we chose a
recursive algorithm, a so-called \emph{deterministic annealing filter}.
It works by assigning successively lower weights to outliers with each
recursion step.
For more details we refer to the respective publications~\cite{genfit1,
genfit2}.
The resulting track is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kalman}.

new:
The final step consists of a Kalman filter for track identification.
For this, we used the well-established GENFIT track fitting
package~\cite{genfit1, genfit2, genfit3}.
Initially we assume a state vector of a minimum-ionising muon with a momentum
of \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt} in the direction of the track estimate from
the PCA in the previous step.
The sign of the momentum is chosen such that the muon travels from the
atmosphere towards Earth.
Likewise, the fit is started from the 3D hit closest to the atmosphere.
GENFIT then extrapolates the state vector towards the next 3D hit in direction
Earth, taking into account ionisation and multiple Coulomb scattering in
liquid argon.
The new state vector is improved based on the residuals between the
extrapolation and the measured 3D hit.
Finally, the process is repeated by extrapolating the new state vector towards
the next 3D hit.
A full track estimate is available after reaching the last 3D hit.
However, the track estimate can still be biased in case of an inferior initial
guess.
Therefore, the final state vector is propagated back in space time once again
to improve the track estimate.
To improve the estimate even further, the entire process is repeated until the
track estimate converges (or a maximum number of iterations is reached).

As a proof of concept we assumed a minimum-ionising muon.
However, the Kalman filter technique is generally applicable to any particle
type.
To deal with potential outliers still remaining after the PCA, we chose a
recursive algorithm, a so-called \emph{deterministic annealing filter}.
It works by assigning successively lower weights to outliers with each
recursion step.

genfit2, genfit3}.
The resulting track is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kalman}.

new:
LArTPCs are intrinsically slow detectors with a drift speed of \SI{2.1}{\milli\metre\per\micro\second} at \SI{1}{\kilo\volt\per\centi\metre}~\cite{protoLASER}.
Therefore, drift lengths of $\order{\SI{1}{\metre}}$ result in readout windows of $\order{\SI{500}{\micro\second}}$.
Deployments in neutrino beams with spills of $\order{\SI{10}{\micro\second}}$~\cite{numi, DUNE3} long will have multiple events pile-up in the same readout window, this is problematic for projective wire readouts.
