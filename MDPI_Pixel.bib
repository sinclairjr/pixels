  Abstract                 = {Electron recombination in highly ionizing stopping protons and deuterons is studied in the ArgoNeuT detector. The data are well modeled by either a Birks model or a modified form of the Box model. The dependence of recombination on the track angle with respect to the electric field direction is much weaker than the predictions of the Jaffe columnar theory and by theoretical-computational simulations.},

Recent technological advances and relevant developments in photon detection and charge readout are discussed in the context of their applicability to those experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including those on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group ( http://pdg.lbl.gov [http://pdg.lbl.gov] ). The printed PDG Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings. A Booklet with the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the review articles is also available. ----- -- Contents ----- --   ----- -- Abstract, Contributors, Highlights and Table of Contents -- Acrobat PDF (150 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0001-0010.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Introduction -- Acrobat PDF (456 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0011-0026.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Particle Physics Summary Tables ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (155 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0029-0031.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (134 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0032-0035.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (84 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0036.pdf] ----- -- Mesons -- Acrobat PDF (871 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0037-0086.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (300 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0087-0102.pdf] ----- -- Searches (Supersymmetry, Compositeness, etc.) -- Acrobat PDF (91 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0103-0104.pdf] ----- -- Tests of conservation laws -- Acrobat PDF (330 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0105-0116.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Reviews, Tables, and Plots ----- -- Detailed contents for this section -- Acrobat PDF (37 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0117-0118.pdf] ----- -- Constants, Units, Atomic and Nuclear Properties -- Acrobat PDF (278 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0119-0131.pdf] ----- -- Standard Model and Related Topics -- Acrobat PDF (7.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0132-0348.pdf] ----- -- Astrophysics and Cosmology -- Acrobat PDF (2.7 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0349-0428.pdf] ----- -- Experimental Methods and Colliders -- Acrobat PDF (3.8 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0429-0516.pdf] ----- -- Mathematical Tools or Statistics, Monte Carlo, GroupTheory       -- Acrobat PDF (1.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0517-0559.pdf] ----- -- Kinematics, Cross-Section Formulae, and Plots -- Acrobat PDF (3.9 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0560-0598.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Particle Listings ----- -- Illustrative key and abbreviations -- Acrobat PDF (235 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0601-0610.pdf] ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0613-0710.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (1.5 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0711-0790.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (1.2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0791-0846.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Light unflavored and strange -- Acrobat PDF (4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0847-1043.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Charmed and bottom -- Acrobat PDF (7.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1044-1363.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Other -- Acrobat PDF (3.1 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1364-1500.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (3.97 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1501-1672.pdf] ----- -- Miscellaneous searches -- Acrobat PDF (2.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1673-1790.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Index -- Acrobat PDF (160 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1791-1808.pdf] -----},

Improvements concern the implementation of additional track-fitting algorithms, enhanced implementations of Kalman fitters, enhanced visualization capabilities, and additional implementations of measurement types suited for various kinds of tracking detectors. The data model has been revised, allowing for efficient track merging, smoothing, residual calculation, alignment, and storage.},

This technique could be exploited by present and next generation large mass LAr TPCs for which monitoring of the performance and calibration play an important role.

Addressing these questions requires a new generation of massive particle detectors to explore the subatomic and astrophysical worlds. ICARUS T600 is the first large mass (760 tons) example of a new generation of detectors able to combine the imaging capabilities of the old famous ``bubble chamber'' with the excellent energy measurement of huge electronic detectors. ICARUS T600 now operates at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory and is used to study cosmic rays, neutrino oscillations and the proton decay. The potential for doing physics of this novel telescope is presented through a few examples of neutrino interactions reconstructed with unprecedented detail. Detector design and early operation are also reported.},
